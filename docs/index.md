# Welcome to My Technical Writing Portfolio

Hi! I'm Zain Haq, a senior technical writer with a passion for translating complex technical concepts into clear and actionable documentation. Over the past several years, I've specialized in:

- **Cloud-native** and **distributed systems**  
- **Data science** and **machine learning** tooling  
- **Docs-as-code** processes (Git, CI/CD, and more)

I believe in the power of great documentation to reduce friction for engineers, data scientists, and business stakeholders alike. Here, you’ll find a selection of my writing samples—covering everything from architectural overviews to Python client tutorials.
